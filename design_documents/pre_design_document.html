<h1 id="what-is-this">What is this?</h1>
<p>This doucment is written prior to the start of the product, it
outlines what the project should do:</p>
<p>Simulate induced demand, by making a simulation of a municipality,
consisting of a road-network, connecting places (and road
intersections), places can be either Homes, Jobs, Activities or shops.
To do this we need to simulate:</p>
<h2 id="people-and-their-travel-plans">People and their travel
plans</h2>
<p>People live in houses and do jobs at places every day, some places
are designated as Grocery shops, which people occasionally NEED to go to
(though they will always choose the nearest); people may also choose to
do leisure activities, which involves going to some places for fun, this
includes parks, movie theatres and whatever and they also have a list of
friends, who they sometimes want to visit.</p>
<p>People always act rationally to increase their own happiness.</p>
<p>People may access different modes of transport (Walking (Can walk at
the side of roads, at the side of bicycle paths or dedicated pedestrian
paths (increased comfort and speed)), Bus Transport (Likely derived from
the same base class and cars, and sharing the same traffic engine,
unless dedicated lanes exist), Trains (using unique rail system) ,
Biking and Private Car (the latter requires owning a bike or car)),
which sometimes follow different paths, and where the time taken depend
on current capacity. People universally want a short commute (Joyriding
is NOT modelled).</p>
<p>People choose the mode of transport which maximizes their happiness
(or choose not to travel to leisure activities if the happiness cost is
too high).</p>
<p>People have access to traffic data from previous days, and will use
that to calculate expected cost (And use a pathfinding algorithm which
minimizes happiness cost).</p>
<p>Ideally, people should be able to chain modes of transport (will
require bicycle and car parking), this may be an advanced feature to be
implemented later</p>
<h2 id="daily-traffic">Daily traffic</h2>
<p>All connections (roads) have a speed limit, and number of lanes,
leading to a capacity.</p>
<p>Individual Motor-vehicles and Bicycles must be physically modelled,
following their designated paths, overtaking, waiting at intersections
etc, waiting in line etc.</p>
<p>Trains and light-rail are not required to be physically modelled, as
they do not dynamically overtake; they can be thought of as timed
"teleporters".</p>
<h2 id="data-input">Data input</h2>
<p>The network setup should store:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Nodes: one of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Intersections: one of the following
<ul>
<li>Traffic light</li>
<li>Road intersection</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Houses:
<ul>
<li>Homes</li>
<li>Jobs</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Stops (bus or train) optionally with parking spots for bikes or
cars</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Paths:</p>
<ul>
<li>Road or bike-path
<ul>
<li>Speed limit</li>
<li>Lanes</li>
<li>Length</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>People:</p>
<ul>
<li>Where they live and work</li>
<li>Optionally personal preferences, like prefered mode of
transport</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="graphics-and-output">Graphics and output</h2>
<p>Detailed data from every day must be available, the program itself
should be commandline only</p>
<p>The program must produce data files (exact format is not decided
a-priori) with:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Per individual journey leg (same mode)</p>
<ul>
<li>Distance travelled</li>
<li>Mode used</li>
<li>ETA</li>
<li>Actual arrival time</li>
<li>Roads used</li>
<li>start time</li>
<li>end time</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Per road:</p>
<ul>
<li>For each Hour:
<ul>
<li>Cars on the road</li>
<li>Average speed</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Speed limit</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>(possibly add more data if need be)</p>
<p>A file with key-framed animations of individual cars and journeys
should be produced by the simulation, which can be re-played by a
Processing program</p>
<h1 id="key-frame-animation-program">Key-frame animation program</h1>
<p>The program for animating the travel should be made in Processing, as
that is easy to program graphics in.</p>
<p>The program should allow zooming in and out, and panning around, and
move forwards and backwards in time.</p>
<p>The animation should play the individual cars physically travelling
along the roads, cars overtaking, waiting at red lights, intersections
etc.</p>
