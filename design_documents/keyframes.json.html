<h1 id="keyframe-data-format">Keyframe data format</h1>
<p>All physical units are in SI units</p>
<p>These files store sthe location of all vehicles, at all critical
time-points (between which the vehicles travel at constant
acceleration)</p>
<p>Each Vehicle element contains some basic, constant information:
specifically <code>"length"</code> (an integer, default 3 in meters) and
<code>"type"</code> which is a string, either car, bus, or truck, (this
is for display purposes only)</p>
<pre><code>{
    &quot;vehicles&quot;:
    [
        {
            &quot;type&quot;:&quot;car&quot;,
            &quot;length&quot;:3,
            &quot;keyframes&quot;:
            [
                {
                    &quot;time&quot;:0,
                    &quot;road&quot;:1,
                    &quot;direction&quot;:true,
                    &quot;lane&quot;:0,
                    &quot;pos&quot;:0,
                    &quot;speed&quot;:0,
                    &quot;acc&quot;:0
                },
                ...

            ]
        },
        ...
    ]
}</code></pre>
<p>The only required element in a key-frame is <code>"time"</code> which
must be greater than last key-frame.</p>
<p><code>"road"</code> is the current road ID in the network,
<code>"direction"</code> is true when travelling from the first node to
the second, and the <code>"lane"</code> is whatever lane we are on now.
<code>"pos"</code> is measured from the start of that road.
<code>"speed"</code> and <code>"acc"</code> are speed and
acceleration.</p>
<p>Anything other than <code>"time"</code> is optional data, if it is
not supplied it is calculated from previous data, i.e. if we at
<code>t=0</code> has all set to 0 and <code>acc=1</code>, and at
<code>t=1</code> has a new key-frame only with <code>acc=0</code>, then
at that point we will have <code>speed=1</code> and
<code>pos=0.5</code>.</p>
<p>The very final keyframe is always treated as a "despawn" command, so
only the time will matter</p>
